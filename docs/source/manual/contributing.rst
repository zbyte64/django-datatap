DataTap is open-source and is here to serve the community by the community.


Philosophy
==========
* DataTap is BSD-licensed. All contributed code must be either
    * the original work of the author contributed under the BSD license
    * work taken form another BSD-compatible license
* GPL or proprietary works are not eligible for contribution
* Master branch represents the current stable release
* Develop branch represents patches accepted for the next release

Reporting Issues
================

* Issues are tracked on github. 
* Please ensure that a ticket hasn't already been submitted before submitting a ticket.
* Tickets should include:
    * A description of the problem
    * How to recreate the bug
    * Version numbers of the relevant packages in your Django stack
    * A pull request with a unit test exemplifying the failure is a plus

Contributing Code
=================

1. Fork it on github
2. Branch from the release and push to your github
3. Apply the changes you need
4. Add yourself to AUTHORS.rst
5. Once done, send a pull request (to the develop branch)

Your pull request / patch should be:

* clear
* works across all supported versions
* follows the existing code style (mostly PEP-8)
* comments included where needed
* test case if it is to fix a bug
* if it changes functionality then include documentation
